# FedChatServer
This is a repository for multi-user chat. You can find the client's part [here](https://github.com/avfe/FedChatClient).

# How to get started?
You can download the server [.jar file](https://github.com/avfe/FedChatServer/blob/master/out/artifacts/ChatServer_jar/ChatServer.jar) and run it from the console.

# Feedback
Any feedback for the further development of the project is important to me. I would be glad to see your letters at avfetech@gmail.com.
